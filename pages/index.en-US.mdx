Creating mods *should be easy*, but the process can be a bit **tricky**, because learning to make mods can be a bit of a challenge. The problem is, what you need to know is **everywhere**, and it's not always obvious.


This is my solution to the problem, a place were you can find all the information you need to know about modding.
Not only that, but this project is opened source and you can contribute to it as well. Currently here is the list of things that needs to get done.

  This website is fairly new and still in development.

- **Find** and **create** documentation on the popular modding tools.
- Create a **guides** for modding
- Make everything easier for everyone
